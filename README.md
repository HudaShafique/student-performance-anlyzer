# Student Marks Analyzer
A Python program to take student marks, calculate total, average, highest, and lowest marks, and display a grade with remarks. 
<br>
This project demonstrates basic Python programming, data handling, and logic useful for future ML projects.

## Features
- Takes student name, roll number, and marks for 5 subjects
- Calculates total, average, highest, and lowest marks
- Assigns a grade based on average and gives remarks
- Displays a clean, easy-to-read student report
