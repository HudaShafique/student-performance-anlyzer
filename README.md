# Student Marks Analyzer
A Python program to take student marks, calculate total, average, highest, and lowest marks, and display a grade with remarks.
<br>  
This project demonstrates basic Python programming, data handling, and logic useful for future ML projects.

## Features
- Takes student name, roll number, and marks for 5 subjects
- Calculates total, average, highest, and lowest marks
- Assigns a grade based on average and gives remarks
- Displays a clean, easy-to-read student report

## Example Output
<br>
Student report
--------------
Name : Ali
Roll no. : 24
enter marks 1: 78
enter marks 2: 89
enter marks 3: 90
enter marks 4: 92
enter marks 5: 86

Marks : [78, 89, 90, 92, 86]
Total :  435
Average :  87.0
Highest :  92
Lowest :  78
Grade : B 
Remark : Good 

## Skills Used
- Python basics: variables, input, loops, conditionals
- Lists and list operations
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Conditional logic for grading

## Future Improvements
